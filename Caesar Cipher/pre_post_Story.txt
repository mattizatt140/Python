Jack Florey is a mythical character created on the spur of a moment to help cover an insufficiently planned hack. 
He has been registered for classes at MIT twice before, but has reportedly never passed a class. It has been the 
tradition of the residents of East Campus to become Jack Florey for a few nights each year to educate incoming 
students in the ways, means, and ethics of hacking.
